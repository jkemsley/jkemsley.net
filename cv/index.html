Alongside Web Development, I am continuously building on my existing Design and Project Management skills. My passion for self-improvement and ability to learn in a fast- paced environment constantly drives me to increase my knowledge across all areas of my profession.</p>

							<h4>/ Software Developer<span>: June 2011 - Present</span></h4>
							<p>As part of Learning Research Development Team, I use Agile methodologies to support, develop and improve the University’s Critical Student Systems.</p>
							<p>I am responsible for designing innovative solutions within our sector, such as improving usability of the PHP based Moodle platform and developing its supporting Ruby and Java applications. I have also garnered experience in supporting applications, frameworks and libraries, including Message Queues, ESBs, Spring and Backbone.</p>
							<p>Whilst in this role, I have redesigned and implemented the complete front end of a core University library system.</p>
						</li>

						<li class='job'>
							<h4>/ Senior Web Developer / Project manager <span>: Feb 2009 - June 2011</span></h4>
							<p>My promotion to Senior Web Developer, made me responsible for the management of a student web development team. My continued management of the University’s departmental websites, expanded to include both the front- end and the PHP based MVC Framework behind them, as well as the added responsibilities of customer consultation, training and recruitment.</p>
							<p>As my knowledge of PHP and general server side development improved, my position evolved from a purely front-end role, to full fledged Web Developer.</p>
							<p>One such departmental website was the radical distrust site (<a href="http://www.kent.ac.uk/english/radicaldistrust/">http://www.kent.ac.uk/english/radicaldistrust/</a>) for which I was the lead designer. I also worked as part of a team to implement the site’s front and backend code.</p>
						</li>

						<li class='job'>
							<h4>/ Junior Web Designer <span>: Nov 2007 - Feb 2009</span></h4>
							<p>As part of the Web Solutions Team, I was closely involved in designing, improving and maintaining the front end of a large number of departmental websites. During this role, I was able to draw upon my knowledge of CSS and Semantic HTML to move away from a purely design role and towards front-end development. This experience helped me improve my knowledge of technologies such as JavaScript and PHP.</p>
